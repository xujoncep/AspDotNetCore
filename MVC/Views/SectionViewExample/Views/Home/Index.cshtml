<h1>What is Section in Layout View</h1>
<p>
    The layout view is a shared template used to maintain a consistent look and feel across all the views in our application.
    In ASP.NET Core MVC, sections within a Layout View provide a way to inject content from a child view into specific places in the layout.
    This feature is useful when we want to include page-specific scripts, styles, or other elements in the layout without affecting our main content area.
